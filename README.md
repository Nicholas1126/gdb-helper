# gdbhelper
gdbhelper is a lightweight helper class to instrument GDB using Python. It also has minimum support for [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda)
commands and experimental support for [pwndbg](https://github.com/zachriggle/pwndbg).

The reason why I didn't just develop a GDB script is that I was really too lazy to learn the API. Plus I wanted to have
a very simple tool that could "keep" my previous debugging configuration without having to re-set it all. If you're
looking for that too, that's where that tool comes in handy!

## Installation
You can either use it in place or install it with setuptools like this:
```bash
$ sudo python setup.py install
```
If you want to modify it while still using it system-wide, you can use this:
```bash
$ sudo python setup.py develop
```
As the script uses [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)'s "process" to launch GDB in a subprocess with an
interactive shell, you should define aliases accordingly. Here are mine:
```bash
alias pwndbg='echo "source ~/security/pwndbg/gdbinit.py" > ~/.gdbinit && /usr/bin/gdb'
alias peda='echo "source ~/security/peda/peda.py" > ~/.gdbinit && /usr/bin/gdb'
alias gdb='echo "" > ~/.gdbinit && /usr/bin/gdb'
```
This way, when you'll use Peda it will be able to launch it from anywhere on your system.

## Basics
Let's begin by using "crackme1" (32b). After an incredibly hard analysis we saw that 0x8048545 seems interesting
(strcmp) so we'll launch our program and break the to see what's going on.
```python
# coding=utf-8


from gdbhelper import Gdb


debug = Gdb("./crackme1")  # (1)
debug.bp("*0x8048545")  # (2)
debug.r("blurp", prompt=True)  # (3)
value = debug.reg("esp")[1]  # (4)
print(debug.x(value, "s"))  # (5)
```
1. We load the binary in GDB (it's not being run yet)
2. We set our breakpoint
3. We run the binary with its argument and inform gdbhelper that we wait for the GDB prompt (because of the BP) before
returning a result
4. We ask for the value of ESP (which is the 1st argument of strcmp)
5. We print it's value and voilÃ !

## Dependancies
[pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)

[libheap](https://github.com/cloudburst/libheap)


You should also get [peda](https://github.com/longld/peda)


## Usage
```python
# coding=utf-8


from pedahelper import Peda


debug = Peda("./abcd", until=">")
debug.bp("*0x0000000000400b69")
debug.r(until="show\n>")
debug.e("new %s" % ("A"*0x75))
debug.e("new %s" % ("A"*0x107))
show = debug.e("show")
user_id = show.split("ID")[1].split("= ")[1].split("\n")[0]
debug.e("free %s" % user_id, prompt=True)
rax, value = debug.reg("rax")
debug.ni()
show = debug.x("0x603000", "gx", 100)
debug.c()
user_id = show.split("ID")[1].split("= ")[1].split("\n")[0]
debug.e("free %s" % user_id, skipbp=True)
debug.e("new %s" % ("A"*0x107))
show = debug.e("show")
user_id = show.split("ID")[1].split("= ")[1].split("\n")[0]
debug.e("free %s" % user_id, prompt=True)
debug.i()

```
